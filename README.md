# STM32 Arduino IS25LQ010B SPI Flash Interface
 Library for SPI Flash (IS25LQ010B) usage on Arduino
 
## Read Before Using

This is NOT a universal SPI flash library and many instructions are unimplemented.
This library will only work properly with the IS25LQ010B flash chip.
It should be trivial to edit the code to work with other models.

## Install Process

Drag and drop "SPIFlash" folder into your Arduino Sketchbook Library Folder.
For portable IDE : %IDEPATH&/portable/sketchbook/libraries

## Usage 

Usage process is detailed in code comments, see the SPIFlash.cpp for more info.
Not all instructions are implemented of yet
